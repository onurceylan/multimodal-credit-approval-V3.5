🔬 Statistical Validation
Friedman Test Implementation
The pipeline implements rigorous statistical testing to compare model performance:

# Friedman test for comparing multiple models across CV folds
statistic, p_value = friedmanchisquare(*cv_matrix)

# Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction
alpha_corrected = 0.05 / (n_models * (n_models - 1) / 2)

KEY FATURES:

Non-parametric testing: No assumptions about data distribution
Multiple comparison correction: Bonferroni adjustment for family-wise error rate
Effect size calculation: Practical significance assessment
Confidence intervals: Statistical uncertainty quantification

Statistical Output Example
📊 Friedman Test Results:
   • Chi-square statistic: 15.234567
   • p-value: 0.001234
   • Significant: Yes (α = 0.05)

🔍 Post-hoc pairwise comparisons:
   • Bonferroni-corrected α: 0.003333
   • XGBoost vs RandomForest: p=0.000123 *** (XGBoost better)
   • XGBoost vs LogisticRegression: p=0.000456 *** (XGBoost better)
   • 3 significant pairwise differences found
